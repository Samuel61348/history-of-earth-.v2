<p>First 4.5 billion years ago. Right after is born, EARTH was a hell of lava. Pretty early in it is history, Earth collided with mars sized object called THEIA. Which formed the moon?
This happened in the first eon of the earth called Hadean
Named after the Greek god of the Underworld.
In this time the atmosphere was mostly CO2 and the ground was molten lava and rocks
After that, 500 million years have passed and the earth entered an eon called Eoarchean. In this eon the lava was cooling and scientist think life entered in this eon.
Water start raining forming the ocean we know now 
For a few million years
Around 3.6 billion years ago the Paleorchean started.
This was the time where gases like CO2, CH4 and H2 O was used for the first time by microorganism. The paleorchean lasted from 3.6 billion - 3.2 billion years.
In this time the day are longer and large continent are underground in3.236 billion years ago.
3.2billion years ago in the Mesorchean the era of continents began tectonic plates begin to crush into each
Other, puling and pushing .the Ocean are 40 Co and micro
Organisms start to expand everywhere. There is no plants for the greenhouse effect and the atmosphere is very hot and no oxygen.
2.8 billion years ago in the Neoarchean began.(2.8billion-2.5 billion years ago)some prokaryotes like bacteria began to colonize the planet.
2.5 billion years ago in the siderian a massive event happened it was called the great oxidation event. Cyanobacteria burp oxygen creating the oxygen layer in large quantities
Ice age happened for the first in the Rhyacian about 2.3 billion - 2.05 billion years ago for millions of years.in 2.2 billion years ago the ice started to melt .
A large asteroid hit earth around 2.05 billion years ago in the orosirian.at that time big mountains are named UR, Nena, Atlantica.
1.8billion years ago in the statherian the super continent
Columbia was born. The Asteroid that hit the earth made A self-sustaining nuclear reactor. 1.6billion years ago around the edge of calimiant   +or- a few hundred million years ago the first eukaryotic cells(cells with a nucleus) merge from two other cell. Sometime in the ectasian 1.4 billion years ago ,earth s inner core was forming 
1.2 billion years ago in the tonian begins, another age where earth is rocks, puddles and oceans.
720million years ago earth in the cyogenian eon freezes over again
635million years ago the super continent gondwana forms and multi cellular organisms start to grow.
539million years ago Cambrian explosion began plants started to explore the land and a massive extinction will happen.
485million years ago to 444million years ago ordovican started.
444millon years ago to 419millon years ago sitarian began.
419million years -359million years the Devonian began. Trees started to expand on the land and water animals start to adopt the land
359million years ago in the carboniterours forests and lush marsh land are at their peak.
Some 299million years ago in the Permian ,pangea the last super continent has formed and after a few ten of million years ,the largest mass extension in history happened killing most of the living things.
252million years ago the trissic begins 201 -145million years are the true age of the reptiles. 145-66 million years is the creoceous.
66-26million years was the time the large asteroid hit earth and led to the extension of all dinosaurs in the paleogen
26-23million years is neogenes </p><br>
